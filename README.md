SourceBrowser.Generator
=======================

C# in. HTML out.

Demo: [sourcebrowser.io/Browse/CodeConnect/SourceBrowser.Generator/](http://sourcebrowser.io/Browse/CodeConnect/SourceBrowser.Generator/)


_What is it?_

SourceBrowser.Generator takes C# solutions and creates HTML files with links between the methods, properties and types.

_Why?_

It's much easier to browse open source and online projects when you can traverse the project easily. GitHub is great, but it's a huge pain in the ass to navigate projects on here.
