SourceBrowser.Generator
=======================

C# in. HTML out.

Demo: [sourcebrowser.io/Browse/CodeConnect/SourceBrowser/](http://sourcebrowser.io/Browse/CodeConnect/SourceBrowser/)


_What is it?_

SourceBrowser.Generator takes C# solutions and creates HTML files with links between the methods, properties and types.

_Why?_

It's much easier to browse open source and online projects when you can traverse the project easily. GitHub is great, but it's a huge pain in the ass to navigate projects on here.

_What languages do you support?_ 

C# and VB .Net, but we'd like to support others.
